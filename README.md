# begot

Begot is a Go dependency manager and build tool. Please read the docstring at
the top of begot.py for a discussion of motivation, design decisions, and
documentation.

Begot is currently written in Python (2.x), though it may be rewritten in Go at
some point in the future. It requires the PyYAML library (`python-yaml` in
Ubuntu or Fedora or `pip install pyyaml`).

Begot is released under a simplified BSD license.
